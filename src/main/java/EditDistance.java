/*
 * In computer science, edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another
 * by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.
 * There are three operations permitted on a word: replace, delete, insert.
 * For example, the edit distance between "a" and "b" is 1, the edit distance between "abc" and "def" is 3.
